# Music Store Data Analysis using SQL
This project is a SQL-based analysis of data from a music store. The goal is to extract insights and answer business questions by querying a database containing information about customers, employees, products, and sales.

### Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following:
- A SQL database containing the music store data
- A SQL client, such as MySQL Workbench or pgAdmin

### Installation

- Clone or download this repository.
- Import the database schema and data into your SQL client.
- Open the SQL query file (`Music Store Analysis.sql`) in your SQL client.
- Run the queries in sequence to obtain the results.

### Files
This project contains the following files:
- `music store data.zip`: The zip file containing datasets and ER Diagrams
- `queries.sql`: The SQL query file containing the analysis queries.
- `README.md`: This file.

### Analysis
The analysis queries in queries.sql cover a range of business questions, such as:

- Which city has the best customers?
- Which artists have written the most rock music? 
- Which are the top 10 rock bands?
- How much amount spent by each customer on artists?
- Which customer has spent the most on music for each
country?

The queries use a variety of SQL concepts and functions, such as joins, aggregates, subqueries, and window functions.

### Future Work
Possible extensions of this project include:

- Developing a dashboard or visualization tool to display the results.
- Adding more data to the database to enable deeper analysis.
- Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict customer behavior or sales trends.
